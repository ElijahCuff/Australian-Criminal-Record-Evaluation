# Australian Criminal Record Evaluation
### Evaluate people's criminal record quickly.   
> get a quick idea of how involved with the law someone is by collecting the number of court appearances in the Australian court records database.

## How It Works ?    
- Court's publish daily court hearings on their websites, some are limited with personal information while others publicly disclose the case's details.    
- A bot was created to scrape every state and territory in Australia for daily and historical court listings, resulting in over 27 million records Australia wide.   
- The bot runs every day collecting new court records, and is owned and maintained by https://cda.courtdata.com.au.    
 
## Why do I need this project ?    
- The CDA Database used to be publicly searchable without needing an account, this made it useful for web applications and software to show results easily from the website, unfortunately they have added a log-in requirement for new users and paid subscription to see further details on case dates.    
- This project was designed to allow a single account holder to share their limited subscription as a service for the public to take advantage of.    
   
The URL's are obfuscated in base64 to stop the CDA website from scraping GitHub and finding the project.   
  
The idea is simple, automatically log-in to a pre-registered burner account, allow free searching - possibly buy the subscription and allow full details for free.
